#+TITLE: Building Recurrent Neural Networks with Tensorflow

* What is Tensorflow
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
  #+END_QUOTE
* Artificial Neural Networks a (not so) short intro
* The key to understanding all the math
  \begin{equation}
  1=1
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  1=sin^2(x)+cos^2(x)
  \end{equation}
  The math is heavy but we need to remember that we started with $1=1$!
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* LSTM networks
* Demo
